// TaskStatus represents the stage of execution for a task. The associated enumeration is ordered,
// where higher value statuses are closer to complete. It's possible for a task to transition from a
// higher status to a lower one if rescheduled. For example, a "running" experiment can move to
// "initializing" if the node it's running on is terminated.
